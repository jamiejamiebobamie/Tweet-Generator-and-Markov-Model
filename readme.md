Dead Writer Tweet Generator

This a web app that generates new text from the works of dead writers. There are currently 7 dead authors on the site:

The Brother's Grimm, Edgar Allan Poe, Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, Lewis Carroll, William Shakespeare, and HP Lovecraft.

The new text is generated using Markov models in public/scripts/tweet.js and can be tweeted from the web app to the 'dead-writers' Twitter account.

This project is no longer in active development. If you have any questions or comments regarding the app, please contact me at jamie.mccrory@students.makeschool.com.
